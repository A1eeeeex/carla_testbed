# Phase 1 Engineering Brief

Last reviewed: 2026-06-16

This brief freezes the Phase 1 engineering target for `carla_testbed`. It is a
scope and status document, not a capability announcement. Status labels below
are based only on repository evidence listed in each row; when evidence is
missing, the status is `NOT_YET` or `UNKNOWN`.

## Long-Term Direction

The long-term goal is not an Apollo-only platform. The long-term goal is:

> A CARLA-based multi-algorithm scenario simulation and evaluation platform.

The platform should eventually support:

- Apollo
- Autoware
- self-developed planning/control modules
- end-to-end models
- VLM / agentic drivers
- other open-source autonomous-driving algorithms

Phase 1 does not try to build that entire platform. Phase 1 uses Apollo as the
first reference backend while preserving a self-written
`PlanningControlBackend` / baseline-style backend so the project can exercise
scenario playback, GT inputs, closed-loop control, artifacts, evaluation, and
comparison in one constrained loop.

## Phase 1 Objective

Phase 1 target:

> Use a fixed scenario player to run reproducible closed-loop comparisons
> between `ApolloBackend` and `PlanningControlBackend` in the same CARLA
> scenario, producing unified artifacts, simple evaluation results, and a
> failure reason.

Phase 1 success does not mean Apollo performs well in every scenario. Phase 1
success means:

1. Fixed scenarios can be replayed reproducibly.
2. Ego is controlled by the selected backend.
3. Non-ego actors are controlled by the fixed scene player.
4. `ApolloBackend` can connect as an external AD-stack-style backend.
5. `PlanningControlBackend` can connect as a self-written module or baseline
   backend.
6. The same scenario case can be run with multiple backends.
7. Every run writes a unified artifact set.
8. Backend comparison can write a simple comparison summary.
9. The system can distinguish backend failure from invalid runs.
10. Simple `v-t-gap` curves can explain longitudinal behavior.

## Phase 1 Non-Goals

Phase 1 does not include:

- Autoware backend work beyond preserving existing experimental support.
- End-to-end image policy integration.
- VLM driver integration.
- Full sensor-level full-stack benchmark.
- Random traffic-flow mining as a core benchmark.
- OpenSCENARIO / ScenarioRunner standardization.
- Web UI.
- Cloud batch scheduling.
- Large-scale scenario library.
- Large-scale black-box parameter search.
- Apollo source-code modification.
- Default physical mapping enablement.
- Automatic calibration-profile promotion; any future promotion would require
  `calibration_report.json` and no-regression gates.
- Treating short-window positives as completed natural-driving evidence.

Those can be future extensions. They are not Phase 1 completion criteria.

## Architecture Boundary

### Scenario Playback Layer

Phase 1 uses the existing `fixed_scene_player` / `scenario_player` surface as
the core fixed scenario playback layer.

It owns:

- fixed scenario actor spawning
- non-ego actor behavior playback
- target actor declaration
- phase events
- scenario actor trace
- fixed scene resolved artifacts

It does not own:

- launching Apollo
- controlling ego
- final evaluation
- judging whether Apollo behavior is good
- A/B comparison
- random traffic-flow behavior

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/`
- `docs/scenario_player.md`
- `configs/scenario_templates/*.yaml`
- `configs/scenarios/baguang/*.yaml`
- `configs/scenarios/town01/*.yaml`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_compiler.py`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_player.py`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_contract.py`

### Backend Layer

Phase 1 focuses on two backend categories:

- `ApolloBackend`
  - External AD-stack / full-stack-like backend.
  - Consumes GT-assisted inputs through adapter/bridge code.
  - Can output Apollo control, trajectory, and debug evidence when available.
- `PlanningControlBackend`
  - Self-written planning/control module or baseline backend.
  - May directly consume `SceneTruth` / scenario truth.
  - Outputs executable control and optionally trajectory/debug.

`PlanningControlBackend` is a Phase 1 target category, not necessarily the
current runtime class name. Current implementation may still use
`carla_builtin` / `simple_acc_route_follower`; do not rename runtime modules
just for documentation consistency.

Phase 1 does not require identical internal inputs for all backends.

> Phase 1 performs scenario-level closed-loop comparison, not identical-input
> algorithm benchmarking.

中文解释：

> 第一阶段进行的是场景级闭环表现对比，不强制所有后端使用完全相同的数据结构或信息粒度。不同后端可以按自身接口消费输入，但必须在 manifest 中声明输入契约、转换路径和可用字段。

The same comparison must still keep these variables aligned:

- same `ScenarioCase`
- same CARLA map
- same fixed scene
- same ego initial condition
- same evaluation artifact surface
- manifest-declared backend input contract
- manifest-declared adapter path
- manifest-declared available truth fields

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/backends/base.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/apollo_cyberrt.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/carla_builtin.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/registry.py`
- `configs/platforms/apollo_cyberrt.yaml`
- `configs/platforms/carla_builtin.yaml`
- `configs/algorithms/apollo/apollo10_carla_gt.yaml`
- `configs/algorithms/builtin/simple_acc_route_follower.yaml`
- `tests/test_platform_backends.py`
- `tests/test_platform_run_plan.py`

### Output Boundary

Phase 1 unifies on executable control:

- throttle
- brake
- steer

Optional backend-specific records:

- planned trajectory
- raw control
- mapped control
- applied control
- high-level decision
- backend debug

The common boundary is closed-loop execution result plus artifacts, not a
single internal interface. Backends with trajectory/debug evidence should record
it, but trajectory is not a mandatory output for every backend.

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/contracts/`
- `carla_testbed/control/simple_acc_route_follower.py`
- `tools/run_builtin_ego_fixed_scene.py`
- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/builtin_ego_runner.py`

## Run And Comparison Units

Minimum run unit:

> `ScenarioRun = ScenarioCase + Backend + RunConfig`

Minimum comparison unit:

> `ScenarioComparison = Same ScenarioCase + Multiple Backend Runs`

Examples:

- `follow_stop_static_300m x ApolloBackend`
- `follow_stop_static_300m x PlanningControlBackend`
- `follow_stop_static_300m: ApolloBackend vs PlanningControlBackend`

Recommended artifact layout:

```text
runs/
  <timestamp>_<scenario_case>_<backend>/
    manifest.json
    resolved_config.yaml
    summary.json
    events.jsonl
    timeseries.*
    fixed_scene_resolved.json
    scenario_actor_trace.jsonl
    scenario_phase_events.jsonl
    plots/

comparisons/
  <scenario_case>_<backend_a>_vs_<backend_b>/
    comparison_manifest.json
    comparison_summary.json
    comparison_curves/
```

Current repository state differs slightly. Standard run artifacts are documented
in `docs/run_artifacts.md`, and `RunArtifactStore` writes
`config.resolved.yaml` rather than `resolved_config.yaml`. Existing fixed-scene
runtime artifacts live under `artifacts/`. Do not rename these paths in Phase 1;
use the brief as the convergence target.

Scenario comparison validity:

- A comparison can judge backend behavior differences only when all
  participating runs are evaluable.
- If any participating run is `invalid`, the comparison must be marked
  `invalid` or `partially_evaluable`.
- An invalid run must not count as a backend loss.

## Phase 1 Scenario Scope

### P0 Scenarios

1. `follow_stop_static`
   - Lead vehicle is stationary with brake hold.
   - Ego approaches and stops.
   - The historical follow-stop target should be interpreted this way for Phase
     1 static follow-stop, not as lead cruise then braking.
2. `lead_decel_accel`
   - Lead vehicle first drives, then decelerates, then accelerates again.
   - Used to inspect ego following, deceleration, and recovery.
3. `cut_in_simple`
   - Adjacent-lane target vehicle cuts in ahead of ego.
   - After cut-in, it becomes the target vehicle.
4. `lane_keep_straight`
   - Straight-lane keeping.
   - Basic lateral gate.
5. `lane_keep_curve`
   - Curve lane keeping.
   - Basic lateral gate.

### P1 Scenarios

6. `cut_out_simple`
   - Lead vehicle cuts out.
   - Inspects target transition and speed recovery.
7. `junction_turn_no_signal`
   - Unsignalized junction / turn passing.
8. `lead_hard_brake`
   - Lead vehicle hard-brakes.
   - Inspects safety boundary.

## Longitudinal Evaluation

Phase 1 should stay simple: status plus `v-t-gap` curves.

Core curves:

- `ego_v_t`
- `target_v_t`
- `gap_t`
- `relative_speed_t`
- optional `ego_accel_t`
- optional `target_accel_t`
- optional `throttle_t`
- optional `brake_t`
- optional `steer_t`

Core gap definition:

> `gap_t` is bumper-to-bumper distance from ego front bumper to target rear
> bumper.

The target vehicle is declared by the scenario player / scenario case in Phase
1. The platform should not use per-frame nearest-front-vehicle guessing as the
main target selection logic. Automatic target selection can be a future fallback.

## Target Actor Contract

Phase 1 target actor resolution is intentionally simple:

1. Prefer an explicit target actor declared by `scenario_case`.
2. If no explicit field exists yet, use the fixed-scene role marker.
3. If both are missing, the run is not evaluable for `v-t-gap` comparison.

P0 fallback rules:

- `follow_stop_static`: target is `lead_vehicle`.
- `lead_decel_accel`: target is `lead_vehicle`.
- `cut_in_simple`: target is `cutin_vehicle`; the gap is active only after the
  scenario phase says the target has entered the ego lane.
- `cut_out_simple`: may require target transition later; this is not required
  for Phase 1 P0.

Nearest-front-vehicle automatic selection is a future fallback only. It must
not be the Phase 1 primary target selection logic.

Simple lateral gates stay available:

- `lateral_error_t`
- `heading_error_t`
- optional `route_progress`
- `off_route`
- `lane_invasion`

Do not introduce a complex comfort score, full TTC taxonomy, or all-purpose
driving score in Phase 1.

## Run Status And Failure Reason

Phase 1 run status:

- `success`
- `degraded`
- `failed`
- `invalid`

Definitions:

- `failed`: the backend failed in an otherwise valid scenario.
- `invalid`: the run itself is not evaluable and must not count as a backend
  loss.

Suggested invalid reasons:

- `setup_failed`
- `missing_target_actor`
- `missing_required_artifact`
- `backend_not_ready`
- `no_timeseries`
- `fixed_scene_failed`
- `config_invalid`

Suggested failed reasons:

- `collision`
- `no_control`
- `stuck`
- `overshoot_target`
- `unsafe_gap`
- `timeout`
- `off_route`
- `lane_invasion`

Suggested degraded reasons:

- `late_response`
- `large_final_gap`
- `small_final_gap`
- `unstable_control`

The important boundary is: scenario-player, artifact, config, or bridge setup
problems are `invalid`, not backend performance failures.

## Artifact Expectations

Each `ScenarioRun` should have:

- `manifest.json`
- `resolved_config.yaml` or `config.resolved.yaml`
- `summary.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `timeseries.*`
- `fixed_scene_resolved.json` when fixed scene playback is used
- `fixed_scene_runtime_state.json` when available
- `scenario_actor_trace.jsonl` when fixed scene playback is used
- `scenario_phase_events.jsonl` when fixed scene playback is used
- ego/control trace when available
- `plots/` for future `v-t-gap` curves

The canonical Phase 1 timeseries surface is `timeseries.*`. Current accepted
formats are `timeseries.csv` and `timeseries.jsonl`. Analysis tools must declare
which format they consume, and this phase must not rename existing artifact
paths just to normalize naming.

Each `ScenarioComparison` should have:

- `comparison_manifest.json`
- `comparison_summary.json`
- `comparison_curves/`
- links to participating run artifacts

Repository evidence:

- `docs/run_artifacts.md`
- `carla_testbed/record/artifact_store.py`
- `tests/unit/recording/test_artifact_store.py`
- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/builtin_ego_runner.py`
- `tools/analyze_baguang_stack_comparison.py`
- `tests/test_baguang_stack_comparison.py`

## Capability Status Table

Status definitions:

- `DONE`: implemented and backed by code, tests, artifacts, or commands.
- `PARTIAL`: there is an implementation surface, but it cannot yet support the
  Phase 1 claim by itself.
- `NOT_YET`: Phase 1 needs it, and no current implementation evidence was
  found.
- `UNKNOWN`: more repository review or a local run is needed.

Implementation note added after the 2026-06-16 review:

- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/target_actor.py` provides the first explicit
  target actor resolver and writes `target_actor_contract` into compiled
  fixed-scene storyboards.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/gap.py` defines the first bumper-to-bumper gap
  utility. Center-distance fallback is marked degraded.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/v_t_gap.py` extracts Phase 1 `v-t-gap` artifacts from
  `timeseries.*` and `scenario_actor_trace.jsonl`.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_status.py` centralizes
  `success/degraded/failed/invalid` run status classification.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/scenario_comparison.py` writes the first generic
  ScenarioComparison report.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_postprocess.py` closes the run-local Phase 1
  artifact spine by writing `analysis/v_t_gap/`,
  `analysis/phase1_status/`, and artifact completeness for a completed
  ScenarioRun.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_scenario_catalog.py` writes a read-only
  P0/P1 catalog that separates case YAML, template compile, CARLA online,
  Apollo online, `v-t-gap`, and comparison evidence. YAML or template evidence
  alone never marks a scenario DONE.
- `StackContract.to_dict()` now emits manifest-compatible `backend_name`,
  runtime start flags, input contract, output control mode, and available truth
  fields so Phase 1 runs can be audited without guessing backend semantics.

These additions improve the offline Phase 1 evaluation spine. They do not by
themselves prove online CARLA playback, Apollo fixed-scene compatibility, or
backend behavior quality.

## Important Current Findings

DONE findings:

- Fixed-scene offline compiler/storyboard construction has code, docs, and unit
  tests.
- Backend facades exist and can be listed without importing runtime stacks.
- `carla_builtin` can build a diagnostic launch plan for Baguang static
  follow-stop.
- Standard artifact writers exist for surfaces such as `manifest.json`,
  `summary.json`, `events.jsonl`, and `timeseries.jsonl`.

PARTIAL findings:

- CARLA online fixed-scene playback exists, but Phase 1 should not mark every
  P0/P1 scenario as online-validated until per-scenario evidence exists.
- Apollo backend is present as a metadata facade and bridge compatibility path,
  but fixed-scene Apollo runtime dispatch is not yet migrated behind the facade.
- The self-written controller exists as `carla_builtin` /
  `simple_acc_route_follower`; `PlanningControlBackend` is the Phase 1 target
  category, not a reason to rename current runtime modules.
- Several P0/P1 scenes exist as templates/configs, but the generic
  `ScenarioCase x Backend` comparison artifact is not frozen.
- Comparison exists for Baguang stack artifacts, but it is not yet a generic
  Phase 1 comparison layer.
- Phase 1 summary semantics, event vocabulary, and docs claim consistency are
  partially defined but not yet a complete evaluator contract.

NOT_YET findings:

- Explicit `lead_hard_brake` scenario.
- Online ApolloBackend vs PlanningControlBackend ScenarioComparison evidence.

New PARTIAL findings from the offline Phase 1 spine:

- Dedicated `v-t-gap` extraction exists with schema `v_t_gap.v1`. Local
  builtin online runs can produce it, but online Apollo-vs-builtin comparison
  curves are still missing.
- Bumper-to-bumper gap calculation exists and `carla_builtin` fixed-scene
  traces now write CARLA bbox-derived vehicle dimensions when CARLA exposes
  them. Old traces without dimensions remain degraded diagnostic evidence.
- Central Phase 1 run status/failure-reason classification exists, and the
  `carla_builtin` fixed-scene runner invokes it automatically after each run.
  Legacy and Apollo online paths still need explicit integration.

UNKNOWN findings:

- Whether all legacy online run paths already write the new manifest-level
  backend input contract fields. New Phase 1/builtin paths do; older tools may
  differ.
- Whether existing CARLA online builtin runs consistently produce complete
  fixed-scene artifacts on every host. The code path exists, but local runtime
  evidence is host-dependent.

## Suggested Phase 1 PR Sequence

1. Add a read-only Phase 1 scenario catalog summary for P0/P1 cases.
2. Add target-role resolver.
3. Add bumper-to-bumper gap utility with vehicle-length inputs and fixtures.
4. Add minimal `v-t-gap` extractor using existing ego timeseries and scenario
   actor trace.
5. Add Phase 1 status/failure classifier that maps existing run artifacts to
   `success`, `degraded`, `failed`, or `invalid`.
6. Add a generic ScenarioComparison report that can initially wrap existing
   Baguang comparison evidence.
7. Add one Apollo fixed-scene compatibility path only after the artifact and
   invalid-run boundaries above are stable.
