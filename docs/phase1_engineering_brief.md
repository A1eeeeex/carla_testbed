# Phase 1 Engineering Brief

Last reviewed: 2026-06-19

This brief freezes the Phase 1 engineering target for `carla_testbed`. It is a
scope and status document, not a capability announcement. Status labels below
are based only on repository evidence listed in each row; when evidence is
missing, the status is `NOT_YET` or `UNKNOWN`.

## Long-Term Direction

The long-term goal is not an Apollo-only platform. The long-term goal is:

> A CARLA-based multi-algorithm scenario simulation and evaluation platform.

The platform should eventually support:

- Apollo
- Autoware
- self-developed planning/control modules
- end-to-end models
- VLM / agentic drivers
- other open-source autonomous-driving algorithms

Phase 1 does not try to build that entire platform. Phase 1 uses Apollo as the
first reference backend while preserving a self-written
`PlanningControlBackend` / baseline-style backend so the project can exercise
scenario playback, GT inputs, closed-loop control, artifacts, evaluation, and
comparison in one constrained loop.

## Phase 1 Objective

Phase 1 target:

> Use a fixed scenario player to run reproducible closed-loop comparisons
> between `ApolloBackend` and `PlanningControlBackend` in the same CARLA
> scenario, producing unified artifacts, simple evaluation results, and a
> failure reason.

Phase 1 success does not mean Apollo performs well in every scenario. Phase 1
success means:

1. Fixed scenarios can be replayed reproducibly.
2. Ego is controlled by the selected backend.
3. Non-ego actors are controlled by the fixed scene player.
4. `ApolloBackend` can connect as an external AD-stack-style backend.
5. `PlanningControlBackend` can connect as a self-written module or baseline
   backend.
6. The same scenario case can be run with multiple backends.
7. Every run writes a unified artifact set.
8. Backend comparison can write a simple comparison summary.
9. The system can distinguish backend failure from invalid runs.
10. Simple `v-t-gap` curves can explain longitudinal behavior.

## Phase 1 Non-Goals

Phase 1 does not include:

- Autoware backend work beyond preserving existing experimental support.
- End-to-end image policy integration.
- VLM driver integration.
- Full sensor-level full-stack benchmark.
- Random traffic-flow mining as a core benchmark.
- OpenSCENARIO / ScenarioRunner standardization.
- Web UI.
- Cloud batch scheduling.
- Large-scale scenario library.
- Large-scale black-box parameter search.
- Apollo source-code modification.
- Default physical mapping enablement.
- Automatic calibration-profile promotion; any future promotion would require
  `calibration_report.json` and no-regression gates.
- Treating short-window positives as completed natural-driving evidence.

Those can be future extensions. They are not Phase 1 completion criteria.

## Architecture Boundary

### Scenario Playback Layer

Phase 1 uses the existing `fixed_scene_player` / `scenario_player` surface as
the core fixed scenario playback layer.

It owns:

- fixed scenario actor spawning
- non-ego actor behavior playback
- target actor declaration
- phase events
- scenario actor trace
- fixed scene resolved artifacts

It does not own:

- launching Apollo
- controlling ego
- final evaluation
- judging whether Apollo behavior is good
- A/B comparison
- random traffic-flow behavior

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/`
- `docs/scenario_player.md`
- `configs/scenario_templates/*.yaml`
- `configs/scenarios/baguang/*.yaml`
- `configs/scenarios/town01/*.yaml`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_compiler.py`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_player.py`
- `tests/test_fixed_scene_contract.py`

### Backend Layer

Phase 1 focuses on two backend categories:

- `ApolloBackend`
  - External AD-stack / full-stack-like backend.
  - Consumes GT-assisted inputs through adapter/bridge code.
  - Can output Apollo control, trajectory, and debug evidence when available.
- `PlanningControlBackend`
  - Self-written planning/control module or baseline backend.
  - May directly consume `SceneTruth` / scenario truth.
  - Outputs executable control and optionally trajectory/debug.

`PlanningControlBackend` is a Phase 1 target category, not necessarily the
current runtime class name. Current implementation may still use
`carla_builtin` / `simple_acc_route_follower`; do not rename runtime modules
just for documentation consistency.

Phase 1 does not require identical internal inputs for all backends.

> Phase 1 performs scenario-level closed-loop comparison, not identical-input
> algorithm benchmarking.

中文解释：

> 第一阶段进行的是场景级闭环表现对比，不强制所有后端使用完全相同的数据结构或信息粒度。不同后端可以按自身接口消费输入，但必须在 manifest 中声明输入契约、转换路径和可用字段。

The same comparison must still keep these variables aligned:

- same `ScenarioCase`
- same CARLA map
- same fixed scene
- same ego initial condition
- same evaluation artifact surface
- manifest-declared backend input contract
- manifest-declared adapter path
- manifest-declared available truth fields

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/backends/base.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/apollo_cyberrt.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/carla_builtin.py`
- `carla_testbed/backends/registry.py`
- `configs/platforms/apollo_cyberrt.yaml`
- `configs/platforms/carla_builtin.yaml`
- `configs/algorithms/apollo/apollo10_carla_gt.yaml`
- `configs/algorithms/builtin/simple_acc_route_follower.yaml`
- `tests/test_platform_backends.py`
- `tests/test_platform_run_plan.py`

### Output Boundary

Phase 1 unifies on executable control:

- throttle
- brake
- steer

Optional backend-specific records:

- planned trajectory
- raw control
- mapped control
- applied control
- high-level decision
- backend debug

The common boundary is closed-loop execution result plus artifacts, not a
single internal interface. Backends with trajectory/debug evidence should record
it, but trajectory is not a mandatory output for every backend.

Current repository evidence:

- `carla_testbed/contracts/`
- `carla_testbed/control/simple_acc_route_follower.py`
- `tools/run_builtin_ego_fixed_scene.py`
- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/builtin_ego_runner.py`

## Run And Comparison Units

Minimum run unit:

> `ScenarioRun = ScenarioCase + Backend + RunConfig`

Minimum comparison unit:

> `ScenarioComparison = Same ScenarioCase + Multiple Backend Runs`

Examples:

- `follow_stop_static_300m x ApolloBackend`
- `follow_stop_static_300m x PlanningControlBackend`
- `follow_stop_static_300m: ApolloBackend vs PlanningControlBackend`

Recommended artifact layout:

```text
runs/
  <timestamp>_<scenario_case>_<backend>/
    manifest.json
    resolved_config.yaml
    summary.json
    events.jsonl
    timeseries.*
    fixed_scene_resolved.json
    scenario_actor_trace.jsonl
    scenario_phase_events.jsonl
    plots/

comparisons/
  <scenario_case>_<backend_a>_vs_<backend_b>/
    comparison_manifest.json
    comparison_summary.json
    comparison_curves/
```

Current repository state differs slightly. Standard run artifacts are documented
in `docs/run_artifacts.md`, and `RunArtifactStore` writes
`config.resolved.yaml` rather than `resolved_config.yaml`. Existing fixed-scene
runtime artifacts live under `artifacts/`. Do not rename these paths in Phase 1;
use the brief as the convergence target.

Scenario comparison validity:

- A comparison can judge backend behavior differences only when all
  participating runs are evaluable.
- If any participating run is `invalid`, the comparison must be marked
  `invalid` or `partially_evaluable`.
- An invalid run must not count as a backend loss.

## Phase 1 Scenario Scope

### P0 Scenarios

1. `follow_stop_static`
   - Lead vehicle is stationary with brake hold.
   - Ego approaches and stops.
   - The historical follow-stop target should be interpreted this way for Phase
     1 static follow-stop, not as lead cruise then braking.
2. `lead_decel_accel`
   - Lead vehicle first drives, then decelerates, then accelerates again.
   - Used to inspect ego following, deceleration, and recovery.
3. `cut_in_simple`
   - Adjacent-lane target vehicle cuts in ahead of ego.
   - After cut-in, it becomes the target vehicle.
4. `lane_keep_straight`
   - Straight-lane keeping.
   - Basic lateral gate.
5. `lane_keep_curve`
   - Curve lane keeping.
   - Basic lateral gate.

### P1 Scenarios

6. `cut_out_simple`
   - Lead vehicle cuts out.
   - Inspects target transition and speed recovery.
7. `junction_turn_no_signal`
   - Unsignalized junction / turn passing.
8. `lead_hard_brake`
   - Lead vehicle hard-brakes.
   - Inspects safety boundary.

## Longitudinal Evaluation

Phase 1 should stay simple: status plus `v-t-gap` curves.

Core curves:

- `ego_v_t`
- `target_v_t`
- `gap_t`
- `relative_speed_t`
- optional `ego_accel_t`
- optional `target_accel_t`
- optional `throttle_t`
- optional `brake_t`
- optional `steer_t`

Core gap definition:

> `gap_t` is bumper-to-bumper distance from ego front bumper to target rear
> bumper.

The target vehicle is declared by the scenario player / scenario case in Phase
1. The platform should not use per-frame nearest-front-vehicle guessing as the
main target selection logic. Automatic target selection can be a future fallback.

Route-only cases such as lane keeping, curve diagnostics, and junction turns do
not require a target actor. Their `v-t-gap` report should be
`status=not_applicable` with a `target_actor_contract.status=not_required`.
That is valid Phase 1 evidence for "no target-gap metric applies"; it is not a
missing target actor failure and it is not a longitudinal-following success.

## Target Actor Contract

Phase 1 target actor resolution is intentionally simple:

1. Prefer an explicit target actor declared by `scenario_case`.
2. If no explicit field exists yet, use the fixed-scene role marker.
3. If the scenario class declares no target actor is required, write
   `target_actor_contract.status=not_required`.
4. If target evidence is required and still missing, the run is not evaluable
   for `v-t-gap` comparison.

P0 fallback rules:

- `follow_stop_static`: target is `lead_vehicle`.
- `lead_decel_accel`: target is `lead_vehicle`.
- `cut_in_simple`: target is `cutin_vehicle`; the gap is active only after the
  scenario phase says the target has entered the ego lane.
- `cut_out_simple`: may require target transition later; this is not required
  for Phase 1 P0.

Nearest-front-vehicle automatic selection is a future fallback only. It must
not be the Phase 1 primary target selection logic.

Simple lateral gates stay available:

- `lateral_error_t`
- `heading_error_t`
- optional `route_progress`
- `off_route`
- `lane_invasion`

Do not introduce a complex comfort score, full TTC taxonomy, or all-purpose
driving score in Phase 1.

## Run Status And Failure Reason

Phase 1 run status:

- `success`
- `degraded`
- `failed`
- `invalid`

Definitions:

- `failed`: the backend failed in an otherwise valid scenario.
- `invalid`: the run itself is not evaluable and must not count as a backend
  loss.

Suggested invalid reasons:

- `setup_failed`
- `missing_target_actor`
- `missing_required_artifact`
- `backend_not_ready`
- `no_timeseries`
- `fixed_scene_failed`
- `config_invalid`

Suggested failed reasons:

- `collision`
- `no_control`
- `planning_control_handoff_missing`
- `stuck`
- `overshoot_target`
- `unsafe_gap`
- `timeout`
- `off_route`
- `lane_invasion`

Suggested degraded reasons:

- `late_response`
- `large_final_gap`
- `small_final_gap`
- `unstable_control`
- `degraded_gap_method`

The important boundary is: scenario-player, artifact, config, or bridge setup
problems are `invalid`, not backend performance failures.

## Artifact Expectations

Each `ScenarioRun` should have:

- `manifest.json`
- `resolved_config.yaml` or `config.resolved.yaml`
- `summary.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `timeseries.*`
- `fixed_scene_resolved.json` when fixed scene playback is used
- `fixed_scene_runtime_state.json` when available
- `scenario_actor_trace.jsonl` when fixed scene playback is used
- `scenario_phase_events.jsonl` when fixed scene playback is used
- ego/control trace when available
- `plots/` for future `v-t-gap` curves

The canonical Phase 1 timeseries surface is `timeseries.*`. Current accepted
formats are `timeseries.csv` and `timeseries.jsonl`. Analysis tools must declare
which format they consume, and this phase must not rename existing artifact
paths just to normalize naming.

Each `ScenarioComparison` should have:

- `comparison_manifest.json`
- `comparison_summary.json`
- `comparison_curves/`
- links to participating run artifacts

Repository evidence:

- `docs/run_artifacts.md`
- `carla_testbed/record/artifact_store.py`
- `tests/unit/recording/test_artifact_store.py`
- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/builtin_ego_runner.py`
- `tools/analyze_baguang_stack_comparison.py`
- `tests/test_baguang_stack_comparison.py`

## Capability Status Table

Status definitions:

- `DONE`: implemented and backed by code, tests, artifacts, or commands.
- `PARTIAL`: there is an implementation surface, but it cannot yet support the
  Phase 1 claim by itself.
- `NOT_YET`: Phase 1 needs it, and no current implementation evidence was
  found.
- `UNKNOWN`: more repository review or a local run is needed.

DONE still means the Phase 1 comparison mechanism and scenario contract are usable, not that every backend behavior passed. Earlier same-case ApolloBackend-vs-PlanningControlBackend evidence isolated a shared near-start `lane_invasion` with near-zero CTE/heading as a road-start Baguang map/sensor contract issue. The offset sweep localized the trigger to spawn 0 / road `s≈0`. The `follow_stop_static_300m_spawn2m` builtin diagnostic runs verified the candidate mitigation with `lane_invasion_count=0` and `baguang_lane_event_contract.status=pass`; the 30s sample also produced `phase1_status=success`. The Apollo shifted-start non-overlay run proved the same runtime offset reached CARLA (`scenario_metadata.ego_spawn_s_offset_m=2.0`, 300m front alignment, lane/collision counts zero, obstacle GT and v-t-gap pass), but failed as `control_process_failed`. The explicit control-overlay diagnostic run restored Apollo control handoff to `warn/failure_stage=none` and generated `/apollo/control`, but then failed as `lane_invasion` after about 55.6m with CTE about `-0.85m`. The refreshed lane-event contract classifies this as `downstream_progressive_lane_departure` with CTE and heading error growing before the event. It now uses `artifacts/control_apply_trace.jsonl` as the authoritative pre-event control source: Apollo raw steer grows to about `-0.159`, mapped/applied steer both reach about `-0.0396`, mapped-to-applied error is `0.0`, raw-to-mapped steer gain averages about `0.244` with final gain `0.25`, and raw/mapped steer share the CTE sign. Refreshed control-health now ignores stale summary materialization fields when stronger routing/planning/handoff artifacts are present. The high-capture refreshed link-health for `20260619_101626` reports `primary_blocker=control_mapping_apply:apollo_raw_command_oscillation`; its primary detail points at `gt_state_sampling_cadence`, with `sensor_capture` as the slowest frame stage, CARLA tick/localization/chassis wall rate about `3.7Hz`, Apollo control RX about `62Hz`, and control-to-GT count ratio about `17`. The low-capture online run disables legacy rig sensor capture and improves runtime cadence (`tick_count=1747`, tick wall p95 about `0.0082s`, localization/chassis wall rate about `19.8Hz`, control-to-GT count ratio about `3.4`), but it still fails as `lane_invasion` and control-health still reports `apollo_raw_command_oscillation`. After postprocess now derives a fixed-scene route trace from runtime front alignment, the route contract records scenario route length about `300m`, CARLA lane signature `0:-2`, and `scenario_class=follow_stop_static`. Its link-health primary blocker is now `route_establishment:apollo_hdmap_projection_for_lane_equivalence`, meaning scenario route intent is visible but official Apollo HDMap projection rows are still missing for CARLA-lane to Apollo-lane equivalence. This is diagnostic progress only, not Apollo capability evidence. | Do not promote the control runtime overlay or low-capture profile to default. Next work is to export official Apollo HDMap projection rows for the Baguang fixed-scene route samples, then rerun the low-capture profile before touching control mapping. Dynamic lead/cut-in scenarios remain Apollo runtime-migration work. |

Latest Apollo follow-stop blocker refinement, `2026-06-18`:

- Refreshed Apollo link-health plus a 300m/no-beyond-front online probe refine
  the Baguang shifted-start overlay blocker from broad long-goal / claim-route
  compatibility to `apollo_routing_goal_projection_disabled_by_config`, with
  `apollo_routing_goal_projection_not_accepted` and
  `apollo_routing_goal_snap_distance_high` as supporting blockers. The probe run is
  `runs/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_goal300_probe_20260618_155124`.
  It still failed with `LANE_INVASION_HARD`, so this is not behavior success.
  It means the next highest-value validation is claim-safe Baguang Apollo goal
  snap / projected endpoint configuration, before control tuning or runtime
  smoothing.
- A follow-up probe with `snap_goal_to_lane=true` is
  `runs/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_goal_snap_probe_20260618_182601`.
  It removed the `disabled_by_config` blocker, but `apollo_route_contract`
  still fails with `apollo_routing_goal_snap_distance_high`; Apollo routing
  length becomes about `305.1m`, and reference-line evidence remains
  insufficient. The run completed 700 ticks with no collision or lane invasion,
  but the harness summary reports `NO_SENSOR_DATA`, so Phase 1 status is
  `invalid/missing_required_artifact`, not backend success.

Latest Apollo follow-stop cadence refinement, `2026-06-19`:

- Refreshed link-health for
  `runs/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_compat_20260619_101626`
  reports `primary_blocker=control_mapping_apply:apollo_raw_command_oscillation`.
  This is not a control-mapping fix request. The primary detail now exposes
  `gt_state_sampling_cadence`: CARLA world/tick health is present, no world
  tick timeout is observed, `sensor_capture` is the slowest frame stage, GT
  localization/chassis publish wall rate is about `3.7Hz`, Apollo control RX
  wall rate is about `62Hz`, and control-to-GT count ratio is about `17`.
  The next diagnostic profile is
  `configs/io/examples/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_low_capture_compat.yaml`,
  which disables legacy rig sensor capture through `record.sensors.enable=false`
  while preserving the same Phase 1 Apollo fixed-scene compatibility boundary.
  A positive cadence change from that profile would be diagnostic only; it
  would not prove Apollo natural driving or justify smoothing/clamping bridge
  output.
- The low-capture online run
  `runs/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_low_capture_compat`
  confirms that `record.sensors.enable=false` disables legacy rig sensor
  capture and materially improves wall-clock cadence: tick p95 drops from about
  `0.286s` to about `0.0082s`, localization/chassis wall rate rises from about
  `3.7Hz` to about `19.8Hz`, and the control-to-GT count ratio falls from about
  `17` to about `3.4`. It still fails with `lane_invasion`, and
  `control_health` still reports `apollo_raw_command_oscillation`. The Apollo
  link-health primary blocker initially shifted to missing scenario route
  fields. After route-contract postprocess consumes runtime
  `artifacts/scenario_metadata.json` front alignment, the same run records a
  `300m` fixed-scene route trace and CARLA lane signature `0:-2`. Exporting
  official Apollo HDMap API projection rows for the same run produces 80/80 ok
  rows over about `301.4m` of projection-s coverage; this moves
  `apollo_route_contract` from `insufficient_data` to `warn` rather than pass,
  because CARLA lane `0:-2` and Apollo lane `0_0_2` remain cross-namespace and
  require explicit equivalence evidence. The refreshed link-health primary
  blocker moves downstream to
  `channel_health:localization:header_sim_gap_over_contract`. This is
  diagnostic progress only; it is not a driving improvement and does not justify
  bridge smoothing or PID tuning before the localization/channel timing contract
  is explained.
- The refreshed channel-cadence diagnosis now records `sim_wall_cadence`. In the
  same low-capture run, CARLA advanced about `87.3s` of sim-time in about
  `11.1s` of wall-time while `wall_time_pacing_enabled=false`. This explains
  why localization/chassis wall delivery can be near `20Hz` while Apollo header
  sim-time cadence is only about `2.5Hz`. The diagnostic follow-up config is
  `configs/io/examples/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_low_capture_paced_compat.yaml`.
  It enables `run.wall_time_pacing.enabled=true` at `0.05s` and exists only to
  test whether pacing restores the sim-time channel contract. A paced-positive
  run would still be diagnostic; it would not prove Apollo natural driving or
  make the overlay/low-capture profile default.
- The paced online sample
  `runs/phase1_baguang_apollo_followstop_static_spawn2m_control_overlay_low_capture_paced_compat`
  confirms the channel-timing hypothesis: `sim_wall_speedup_factor≈0.98`,
  localization/chassis header sim cadence about `19.1Hz`, max gap about
  `100ms`, and `channel_cadence_diagnosis.status=warn` with no blocking
  reasons. The same run still fails as `phase1_status=failed` /
  `failure_reason=lane_invasion`. After official HDMap projection export,
  `apollo_hdmap_projection.status=pass` / `claim_grade=true`,
  `apollo_reference_line_contract.status=warn`, and link-health primary blocker
  moves to `apollo_module_consumption:claim_route_consumption_unverified`.
  This is a blocker shift, not a behavior improvement claim.

Implementation note added after the 2026-06-16 review:

- `carla_testbed/scenario_player/target_actor.py` provides the first explicit
  target actor resolver and writes `target_actor_contract` into compiled
  fixed-scene storyboards.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/gap.py` defines the first bumper-to-bumper gap
  utility. Center-distance fallback is marked degraded.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/v_t_gap.py` extracts Phase 1 `v-t-gap` artifacts from
  `timeseries.*` and `scenario_actor_trace.jsonl`. Its CSV surface records
  `gap_degraded_reason` and route/lane metadata so a review can distinguish
  bbox-based bumper gap, same-lane `route_s_bumper_gap`,
  fixed-scene `trajectory_progress_bumper_gap`, and diagnostic fallback or
  degraded projection gap.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_status.py` centralizes
  `success/degraded/failed/invalid` run status classification. Preflight/setup
  invalid reasons such as `backend_not_ready` take priority over missing raw
  traces, so an Apollo scaffold without runtime artifacts is not rewritten as a
  behavior failure or plain `no_timeseries`.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/scenario_comparison.py` writes the first generic
  ScenarioComparison report. Combined `v-t-gap` curves are written as
  `comparison_curves/v_t_gap_combined.csv` and include only evaluable runs;
  invalid runs remain visible in the manifest/summary but are excluded from
  behavior curves.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_postprocess.py` closes the run-local Phase 1
  artifact spine by writing `analysis/v_t_gap/`,
  `analysis/phase1_status/`, and artifact completeness for a completed
  ScenarioRun. When rerun on an existing run directory, it refreshes only the
  Phase 1 echo fields in `summary.json`; it does not rewrite runtime
  `status/success` fields.
- `carla_testbed/experiments/phase1_scenario_binding.py` can now bind both
  fixed-scene and route-only scenario specs to legacy/compat run directories.
  Route-only binding writes `target_actor_contract.status=not_required` and
  does not create `fixed_scene_resolved.json`, so it can identify cases such as
  `town01_junction_031` without inventing fixed-scene evidence.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/phase1_scenario_catalog.py` writes a read-only
  P0/P1 catalog that separates case YAML, template compile, CARLA online,
  Apollo online, `v-t-gap`, comparison evidence, and optional `--evidence-root`
  ingestion. YAML or template evidence alone never marks a scenario DONE. The
  catalog also emits per-scenario `next_action` hints derived from missing
  evidence and representative Apollo blockers; these are triage prompts, not
  readiness gates.
- `StackContract.to_dict()` now emits manifest-compatible `backend_name`,
  runtime start flags, input contract, output control mode, and available truth
  fields so Phase 1 runs can be audited without guessing backend semantics.
- `tools/run_phase1_scenario.py` now writes a structured Apollo fixed-scene
  preflight scaffold. When runtime is not migrated, it records
  `invalid/backend_not_ready` instead of producing an empty launch plan or
  silently counting Apollo as a behavior loss.
- `carla_testbed/analysis/scenario_comparison.py` now records
  `comparison_target_status` and `backend_coverage`. A same-backend regression
  and an ApolloBackend-vs-PlanningControlBackend comparison are no longer
  conflated.

These additions improve the offline Phase 1 evaluation spine. They do not by
themselves prove online CARLA playback, Apollo fixed-scene compatibility, or
backend behavior quality.

## Important Current Findings

Latest local validation snapshot, `2026-06-19`:

- Full CI-friendly pytest passed locally after the route-only junction binding
  and online comparison update: `1861 passed in 65.29s`.
- Local CARLA `carla_builtin` diagnostic samples now exist for all current
  P0/P1 catalog rows. Fixed-scene target cases produce `v_t_gap_status=pass`;
  route-only lane/curve/junction cases produce `v_t_gap_status=not_applicable`
  with `target_actor_contract.status=not_required`.
- Representative new local run evidence includes:
  `runs/phase1_online_builtin_lane_keep_safety_surface_20260619_163934/`,
  `runs/phase1_online_builtin_curve217_diagnostic_20260617_135025/`,
  `runs/phase1_online_builtin_junction_031_20260617_135035/`, and
  `runs/phase1_online_builtin_cut_out_20260617_134507/`, plus
  `runs/phase1_builtin_lead_accel_decel_097_goal_cycle_20260618_031551/`
  for the current lead speed-change target case.
- Apollo scaffold comparisons now exist for all current P0/P1 catalog rows, and
  four real Apollo-vs-builtin Phase 1 comparisons now exist:
  `runs/phase1_comparisons/lane_keep_real_apollo_vs_builtin_safety_surface_20260619_164004/`,
  `runs/phase1_comparisons/follow_stop_097_apollo_vs_builtin_20260618_030308/`, and
  `runs/phase1_comparisons/curve217_apollo_cadence_hotpath_validation2_vs_builtin_20260619_180900/`,
  plus
  `runs/phase1_comparisons/junction031_apollo_online_lateral_20260619_181629_vs_builtin_20260619_181912/`.
  These comparisons are `comparable` with
  `comparison_target_status=apollo_vs_planning_control_evaluable`.
- The generated catalog currently reports `4` DONE scenarios, `4` PARTIAL, and
  `0` NOT_YET. `lane_keep_straight`, `lane_keep_curve`,
  `junction_turn_no_signal`, and `follow_stop_static` are DONE as Phase 1
  scenario-platform evidence, not as Apollo natural-driving success.
  In `follow_stop_097`, Apollo is evaluable `failed/unsafe_gap`, and
  `carla_builtin` is evaluable `failed/scenario_phase_trigger_not_reached`.
  In `junction_turn_no_signal`, the new Apollo route-only run is evaluable
  `failed/route_establishment_latency` after explicit route-only
  `phase1_scenario_binding`; `v_t_gap` is `not_applicable` because the case has
  no target actor. Remaining PARTIAL rows are fixed-scene target cases that
  still primarily need evaluable ApolloBackend online evidence.
- The generated catalog now separates Apollo fixed-scene bridge-config
  readiness from Apollo fixed-scene runtime dispatch. A readiness report can be
  `DONE` while `apollo_fixed_scene_runtime_dispatch_status=PARTIAL` with
  `apollo_fixed_scene_runtime_not_migrated`; that remains setup evidence, not
  Apollo behavior evidence.

Implementation note added after the 2026-06-17 continuous loop:

- New Phase 1 scaffold and builtin manifest paths write `fixed_scene_case`,
  `target_actor_contract`, and `artifact_contract_version`. These are input
  contract fields, not behavior success evidence.
- `phase1_status.json` now echoes the target actor and artifact contract used
  for classification. Resolved/v-t-gap evidence overrides static manifest
  intent, so a later `missing_target_actor` finding is not hidden by manifest
  defaults.
- `phase1_scenario_catalog.json` now lists concrete `scenario_case_ids`,
  `case_files`, and `target_actor_contract` alongside readiness fields. It
  remains an orchestration summary and only marks a scenario DONE after online
  ApolloBackend and PlanningControlBackend comparison evidence is present.
- P1 `lead_hard_brake` now has a Baguang ScenarioCase YAML and compiler test.
  This moves the case definition from missing to PARTIAL; online playback and
  cross-backend comparison remain unproven.
- The current catalog reports `2` DONE scenarios, `6` PARTIAL, and `0`
  `NOT_YET`. The DONE rows are `lane_keep_straight` and
  `follow_stop_static`; their Apollo participating runs are evaluable failures,
  so this is scenario-platform readiness, not a capability pass.
- `carla_builtin` route-only scenarios now write Phase 1 artifacts without
  fixed-scene actor files. The postprocess spine treats their `v-t-gap` report
  as `not_applicable`, not `invalid`.

DONE findings:

- Fixed-scene offline compiler/storyboard construction has code, docs, and unit
  tests.
- Backend facades exist and can be listed without importing runtime stacks.
- `carla_builtin` can build a diagnostic launch plan for Baguang static
  follow-stop.
- Standard artifact writers exist for surfaces such as `manifest.json`,
  `summary.json`, `events.jsonl`, and `timeseries.jsonl`.

PARTIAL findings:

- CARLA online playback exists for current P0/P1 rows through `carla_builtin`,
  but those runs are diagnostic PlanningControlBackend evidence only. They are
  not Apollo/Autoware capability evidence and do not make Phase 1 DONE.
- Apollo backend is present as a metadata facade and bridge compatibility path.
  One legacy `follow_stop_097` Apollo run is now cataloged as evaluable
  `failed/unsafe_gap`, while most fixed-scene Apollo rows are still scaffold or
  readiness-only invalid evidence. Fixed-scene Apollo runtime dispatch is not
  yet fully migrated behind the facade.
- The self-written controller exists as `carla_builtin` /
  `simple_acc_route_follower`; `PlanningControlBackend` is the Phase 1 target
  category, not a reason to rename current runtime modules.
- Generic `ScenarioCase x Backend` comparison artifacts exist. `lane_keep_097`
  and `follow_stop_097` now have real Apollo-vs-builtin comparable reports.
  The refreshed lane-keep builtin run includes explicit collision/lane-invasion
  counter surfaces, so the comparison is no longer blocked by
  `safety_event_evidence_mismatch`. `follow_stop_097` is comparable because the
  builtin run is now classified as evaluable
  `failed/scenario_phase_trigger_not_reached` instead of invalid setup failure.
  The remaining fixed-scene target scenarios are still only partially evaluable
  because ApolloBackend runs are scaffold, readiness-only, invalid, or missing.
- Apollo fixed-scene target-actor runs are invalid if the target actor is not
  proven to enter Apollo perception through `obstacle_gt_contract` evidence.
  This keeps a missing lead/cut-in obstacle from being counted as an Apollo
  backend behavior loss.
- ScenarioComparison now records active/blocking assists from run artifacts.
  Explicit blocking assists keep the run visible as assisted evidence but
  prevent the comparison from satisfying the Phase 1 reference-backend target;
  assisted failures are not counted as reference-backend losses.
- Fixed-scene playback validity includes scenario actor behavior contracts, not
  just artifact presence and phase start/completion. If
  `analysis/scenario_actor_contract/scenario_actor_contract_report.json` fails,
  Phase 1 classification is `invalid/fixed_scene_failed` before considering
  `v-t-gap` unsafe-gap evidence. This keeps a non-ego actor playback failure,
  such as a lead vehicle missing its speed profile, from being counted as a
  backend behavior loss.
- The latest local `lead_accel_decel_097` builtin online sample
  (`runs/phase1_builtin_lead_accel_decel_097_goal_cycle_20260618_031551/`) now
  produces complete artifacts, valid fixed-scene playback, valid scenario actor
  speed-profile evidence, and `v-t-gap`. Same-lane rows use
  `route_s_bumper_gap` only when CARLA lane-s agrees with the actor-trace
  forward anchor; rows with `route_s_anchor_conflict` or lane/road transitions
  use `trajectory_progress_bumper_gap`, so `v_t_gap.status=pass`. This run is
  Phase 1 `success` with final gap around 25.5m and minimum gap around 16.1m.
  This proves the `PlanningControlBackend` diagnostic path can exercise the
  speed-change ScenarioCase with an evaluable target-gap surface; it is not
  Apollo/Autoware capability evidence. The next work is same-ScenarioCase
  Apollo compatibility evidence and, for natural-driving claims, stronger
  route/Frenet target-gap evidence across lane transitions.
- Phase 1 summary semantics, event vocabulary, and docs claim consistency are
  partially defined but not yet a complete evaluator contract.

NOT_YET findings:

- Evaluable ApolloBackend fixed-scene target-scenario comparison evidence.

New PARTIAL findings from the offline Phase 1 spine:

- Dedicated `v-t-gap` extraction exists with schema `v_t_gap.v1`. Local
  builtin online runs can produce it, but online Apollo-vs-builtin comparison
  curves are still missing.
- Degraded gap methods are now represented separately from behavioral large
  final gap outcomes. A run that only has center-distance or legacy lead-gap
  fallback can be evaluable/degraded, but the fallback is not claim-grade
  bumper-to-bumper gap evidence.
- Longitudinal projection gap is also degraded when the target's lateral offset
  exceeds the projection-validity boundary. In that case Phase 1 status may be
  `degraded/degraded_gap_method`; it must not convert a degraded negative
  projection into `failed/unsafe_gap`.
- Same-lane `route_s_bumper_gap` can replace ego-frame projection for rows with
  comparable route/lane metadata. CARLA lane-local `waypoint.s` direction is
  signed by an explicit forward/longitudinal anchor and the report records
  whether direction correction was applied. Rows with lane-id mismatch or
  route-s/anchor conflict do not mix lane-local `route_s`; they either use
  fixed-scene trajectory-progress evidence or remain degraded if progress
  evidence is insufficient.
- `trajectory_progress_bumper_gap` is now available as Phase 1 fixed-scene
  observed gap evidence for lane/road transitions. It can make a ScenarioRun
  evaluable for longitudinal behavior, but it remains separate from
  claim-grade Apollo HDMap/Frenet projection evidence.
- Bumper-to-bumper gap calculation exists and `carla_builtin` fixed-scene
  traces now write CARLA bbox-derived vehicle dimensions when CARLA exposes
  them. Old traces without dimensions remain degraded diagnostic evidence.
- Central Phase 1 run status/failure-reason classification exists, and the
  `carla_builtin` fixed-scene runner invokes it automatically after each run.
  Legacy and Apollo online paths still need explicit integration.

UNKNOWN findings:

- Whether all legacy online run paths already write the new manifest-level
  backend input contract fields. New Phase 1/builtin paths do; older tools may
  differ.
- Whether existing CARLA online builtin runs consistently produce complete
  fixed-scene artifacts on every host. The code path exists, but local runtime
  evidence is host-dependent.

## Suggested Phase 1 PR Sequence

1. Add a read-only Phase 1 scenario catalog summary for P0/P1 cases.
2. Add target-role resolver.
3. Add bumper-to-bumper gap utility with vehicle-length inputs and fixtures.
4. Add minimal `v-t-gap` extractor using existing ego timeseries and scenario
   actor trace.
5. Add Phase 1 status/failure classifier that maps existing run artifacts to
   `success`, `degraded`, `failed`, or `invalid`.
6. Add a generic ScenarioComparison report that can initially wrap existing
   Baguang comparison evidence.
7. Add one Apollo fixed-scene compatibility path only after the artifact and
   invalid-run boundaries above are stable.
